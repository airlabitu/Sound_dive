  How to set up Kinect Tracking for Windows 10, 64bit:
 
 1) Download and install Kinect 1.7 SDK
 2) Download Zadig and replace the drivers for
       Xbox NUI Camera
       Xbox NUI Motor
       Kinect Audio Device
    with LibusbK.
 
 The kinect should now work. If the error "Isochronous transfer error: 1" appears, don't panic, it should work. If screen remains grey, try restarting the sketch a couple of times.
